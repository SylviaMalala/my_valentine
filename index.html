                    <h2>To My Dearest Husband,</h2>
                    
                    <p>My love, as I write these words to you, my heart is filled with an overwhelming amount of love and gratitude. Every moment we spend apart only makes my love for you grow stronger, and my longing to be reunited with you more intense.</p>
                    
                    <p>From Kenya to the USA, the distance between us is merely physical - our hearts remain intertwined, beating as one. I dream of the day when I will finally be in your arms again, when we can build our future together on American soil, side by side, hand in hand.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your endurance through these challenging times has shown me the depth of your character and the strength of your commitment. You have been my rock, my anchor, my safe haven even from thousands of miles away.</p>
                    
                    <p>I want to thank you for your unwavering love that transcends distance and time. Your financial support has not just sustained me, but has shown me how deeply you care. Every sacrifice you make, every long hour you work, every penny you send - they are all expressions of your love that I treasure deeply.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your care, your thoughtfulness, your sweet messages and calls - they light up my darkest days and fill my heart with hope. You make me feel cherished, valued, and loved in ways I never thought possible.</p>
                    
                    <p>Soon, my darling, soon we will be together. I count down the days until I can hold you, kiss you, and wake up next to you every morning. Until then, know that you are always in my thoughts, in my prayers, and forever in my heart.</p>
                    
                    <p>I love you more than words can express, more than the stars in the sky, more than all the grains of sand on all the beaches in the world.</p>
                    
                    <div class="letter-closing">
                        <p>Forever yours,</p>
